WORKOUT TRACKER API CONFIGURATION FIX

Since your application is hosted at workout-tracker-client-three.vercel.app but we don't have access to deploy to that domain directly, you'll need to update your frontend to point to our new API endpoint.

Here are the steps to fix the API configuration:

1. Go to the Vercel dashboard and look for your most recent deployment URL. It should be something like:
   https://workout-tracker-client-1kgrxowuk-bryandiazdevs-projects.vercel.app

2. Update your frontend environment variables to use this URL for API calls:
   - If you're using a .env file or environment variables, update VUE_APP_API_URL to:
     VUE_APP_API_URL=https://workout-tracker-client-1kgrxowuk-bryandiazdevs-projects.vercel.app/api

3. Alternatively, you could update your frontend code to directly use this URL:
   - Find ApiService.js and update the API_URL constant:
     const API_URL = 'https://workout-tracker-client-1kgrxowuk-bryandiazdevs-projects.vercel.app/api';

4. Deploy your frontend with these updates.

This will point your frontend application to the new API endpoints we've set up, which should resolve the 404 errors you're seeing.

Note: The exact URL will depend on your most recent deployment. Replace the example URL above with your actual deployment URL.
