# Auth0 Authentication Fix

## The Issue

There was a problem with how the Auth0 authentication URL was being constructed. When attempting to log in, you were seeing an error with a URL like:

```
vue_app_auth0_domain=dev-47c4icnwccbjdiz5.us.auth0.com/authorize?client_id=...
```

This happened because the environment variable `VUE_APP_AUTH0_DOMAIN` wasn't being properly substituted during the build process, causing the literal text of the variable name to be included in the URL.

## The Updated Solution

We've fixed this issue with several enhancements to ensure environment variables are properly processed:

1. **Enhanced AuthService.js**: Modified the service to use a runtime configuration approach that safely accesses environment variables.

2. **Improved webpack configuration**: Updated vue.config.js to use webpack's DefinePlugin to properly replace environment variables during the build process.

3. **Better dependency management**: Added webpack as a dev dependency to ensure proper variable substitution.

4. **Enhanced deployment script**: Updated deploy.sh to verify that environment variables are correctly set before deployment.

## Security Benefits

This approach provides several security benefits:

1. **No hardcoded credentials**: Sensitive values are stored in environment variables, not in the code.

2. **Better secret management**: Vercel securely stores environment variables separate from code.

3. **Masked logging**: In development, sensitive values are masked in logs (only showing first few characters).

4. **Production safety**: In production, the environment variables are properly injected during build time.

## Auth0 Application Configuration

For reference, your Auth0 configuration values should be stored as environment variables:

- **VUE_APP_AUTH0_DOMAIN**: Your Auth0 tenant domain
- **VUE_APP_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID**: Your Auth0 application client ID
- **VUE_APP_AUTH0_AUDIENCE**: API audience for authentication
- **VUE_APP_AUTH0_CALLBACK_URL**: https://workout-tracker-rose.vercel.app/callback

Make sure your Auth0 application settings in the Auth0 dashboard match these values, particularly the callback URL.

## How to Deploy

Follow these steps to deploy with the fixed Auth0 authentication:

1. Run the updated deployment script:
   ```bash
   ./deploy.sh
   ```

2. When prompted, choose "y" to update environment variables

3. Enter your Auth0 configuration values when prompted

4. The script will:
   - Install required dependencies
   - Verify your environment variables
   - Build the application with proper environment variable substitution
   - Deploy to Vercel with environment variables securely stored

## Testing Authentication

After deploying, test authentication by:

1. Visit your application at https://workout-tracker-rose.vercel.app
2. Click on the login button
3. You should be redirected to the Auth0 login page
4. After logging in, you should be redirected back to your application

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Check browser console**: Look for any Auth0 configuration logs to verify variables were injected

2. **Verify environment variables in Vercel**: 
   ```bash
   vercel env ls
   ```

3. **Check Auth0 application settings**:
   - Make sure the callback URL in Auth0 matches your environment variable
   - Confirm that the application type is set to "Single Page Application"

4. **Run locally to debug**:
   ```bash
   cd WorkoutTracker.Client
   npm run dev
   ```
   
5. **Examine build logs**:
   Look for the "Building with environment variables:" section in the build logs to confirm that variables are being detected during build.
