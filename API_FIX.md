# API Fix for WorkoutTracker

## Problem Overview

The API was returning a 404 error for the `/api/Goals` endpoint, and MongoDB data was not being saved. There were several issues:

1. A file name mismatch (`Goals.js` vs `goals.js`) causing 404 errors
2. The MongoDB URI environment variable was not being correctly accessed by the Vercel serverless functions
3. Proper error handling and debugging information was missing from the API endpoints

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Created Correct Route Handlers

- Created a `Goals.js` file (with capital G) to handle requests to `/api/Goals`
- Improved the implementation in `lowercase-goals.js` with better error handling and debugging
- Added token parsing to extract the user ID from the Auth0 token

### 2. Enhanced MongoDB Connection

- Improved the `db.js` file with better error handling and connection options
- Added detailed logging to help diagnose connection issues
- Added better handling of database name extraction from the URI

### 3. Environment Variable Configuration

- Updated `vercel.json` to include an `env` section referencing the MongoDB URI
- Created an environment test endpoint at `/api/env-test` to verify environment variables
- Added the MongoDB package to the root `package.json`

### 4. Created Deployment Helper Script

- Developed `fix-api-mongodb.sh` to automate configuration and deployment
- The script checks for MongoDB URI in local files and adds it to Vercel
- Automatically creates missing files and configurations

## How to Use the Fixes

1. **Run the MongoDB Fix Script**:
   ```bash
   ./fix-api-mongodb.sh
   ```
   Follow the prompts to set up MongoDB with Vercel.

2. **Test Environment Variables**:
   Visit `https://workout-tracker-rose.vercel.app/api/env-test` to verify environment variables.

3. **Deploy the Application**:
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

4. **Test the API Endpoints**:
   - Goals API: `https://workout-tracker-rose.vercel.app/api/goals`
   - Environment Test: `https://workout-tracker-rose.vercel.app/api/env-test`

## Troubleshooting

If the API still doesn't work after deployment:

1. **Check Environment Variables**:
   Visit `/api/env-test` to verify that the MongoDB URI is available to your API.

2. **Inspect Logs**:
   Check Vercel logs for your deployment to look for connection errors.

3. **Verify MongoDB Access**:
   - Ensure the MongoDB Atlas cluster allows connections from all IP addresses (0.0.0.0/0)
   - Check that the database user has the correct permissions
   - Verify that the connection string includes the correct database name

4. **Request Body Issues**:
   If data is not being saved correctly, the API now logs request body details to help diagnose
   parsing issues with the payload.

## Testing Changes

To test if your MongoDB connection is working:

1. Visit `https://workout-tracker-rose.vercel.app/api/goals` to fetch goals
2. Use the API in the application to create new goals
3. Check MongoDB Atlas to verify that data is being saved

## Next Steps

1. Set up MongoDB Realm or Data API for more secure database access
2. Implement proper user identification using Auth0 tokens
3. Add comprehensive error reporting and monitoring
4. Optimize database queries for performance
