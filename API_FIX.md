# API Fix for WorkoutTracker - UPDATED

## Problem Overview

The API was returning a 404 error for the `/api/Goals` endpoint, and MongoDB data was not being saved. There were several issues:

1. A file name mismatch (`Goals.js` vs `goals.js`) causing 404 errors in the Vercel deployment
2. The MongoDB URI environment variable was not being correctly accessed by the Vercel serverless functions
3. Proper error handling and debugging information was missing from the API endpoints

## Latest Fixes Implemented

### 1. Consolidated API Handlers

- Moved all implementation to the `goals.js` file (lowercase) with extensive error handling
- Created a separate `Goals.js` file (uppercase) that simply imports and reuses the handler from `goals.js`
- This approach ensures that both endpoint variants (`/api/goals` and `/api/Goals`) use the exact same handler code

### 2. Enhanced MongoDB Connection

- Improved the `db.js` file with better error handling and connection options
- Added detailed logging to help diagnose connection issues
- Added better handling of database name extraction from the URI

### 3. Environment Variable Configuration

- Verified that the MongoDB URI is correctly set up in Vercel (using the `/api/env-test` endpoint)
- Enhanced user ID extraction from Auth0 tokens for proper data ownership
- Improved request body parsing to handle different content formats

## Testing the Fix

1. **Check Environment Variables**:
   Visit `https://workout-tracker-rose.vercel.app/api/env-test` to verify that environment variables are correctly set up.

2. **Test Lowercase API Endpoint**:
   The lowercase endpoint is already working: `https://workout-tracker-rose.vercel.app/api/goals`

3. **Test Uppercase API Endpoint** (after deployment):
   This should now work with the same handler: `https://workout-tracker-rose.vercel.app/api/Goals`

## Deployment Instructions

1. **Deploy the Updated Files**:
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

2. **Test Both API Endpoints**:
   After deployment, test both endpoint variations (with and without the capital G) to ensure they're working properly.

3. **Verify Data Storage**:
   Create a new goal in the application and verify that it's stored in the MongoDB cluster.

## Troubleshooting

If you continue to encounter issues:

1. **Check Vercel Logs**: After deployment, use the Vercel dashboard to check for any API errors or exceptions.

2. **Test with Authentication**: Remember that the API endpoints require a valid Auth0 token. Your browser tests should include the Authorization header.

3. **Verify MongoDB Network Access**: Ensure your MongoDB Atlas cluster allows connections from Vercel's IP range (ideally, set it to allow connections from anywhere during testing).

4. **Check Token Extraction**: The API now attempts to extract the user ID from the Auth0 token. Verify the token contains the expected `sub` claim.

## Next Steps

1. Set up MongoDB Realm or Data API for more secure database access
2. Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring
3. Add schema validation for API requests
4. Optimize performance with proper indexes on MongoDB collections
